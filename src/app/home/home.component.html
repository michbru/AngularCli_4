<p>Disclaimer: I make no full claim of originality (per se) of this Kitchen Sink Assortment. As I learn Angular I adapt work of others who I have learned from.&nbsp; I change an entity. I add a new piece of functionality.&nbsp; Any published code I leverage here in this project I do so in my continued learning efforts and share here with others.</p>
